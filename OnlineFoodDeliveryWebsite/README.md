SwigZato is a food delivery website,

As it is said it is a online food delivery website, it took order from the customer and give the order to the restaurant. The restaurant send the delivery boy with the order.

Here the intersting question arise that that how the delivery boy know that he is delivering to the right customer, for that there is a OTP 
which is recieved by the customer on ordering anything. First the delivery boy take OTP and verify it by submit that OTP in the owner page where he recieved the order. If the OTP varified means he reached to the right customer.
